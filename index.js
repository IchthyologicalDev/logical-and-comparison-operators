/*
Welcome to the arithmetic operators exercise! You'll get to practice writing functions
that use some common arithmetic operators. If you get stuck, follow the tips on the 
webpage.

Look through this file for requirements that start with REQUIREMENT N:
Be sure to use the function name and order of parameters specified in the TODOs

As an example,
REQUIREMENT 1: My calculator is broken. When I try to do 5 + 5, it returns 55.

TODO: On the following lines, create a function named 'add' that takes in two parameters
that are either strings or numbers and returns the numeric sum

EXAMPLE CALL
add('5', '5') returns 10
//YOUR FUNCTION GOES BELOW THIS LINE
function add(x,y) {
    //your logic would go here
}

This function would not pass, since it clearly doesn't return the numeric sum

You will occasionally see longer comments (like this one) that will include extra
instruction, helpful hints, best practices, or other content. 

IMPORTANT
You should have the index.html file open in your browser as you work through this
exercise. If you aren't sure what this means, you should watch the How to Edit Code 
video: https://youtu.be/vkWDQzl_x3s before continuing.

Have fun casting strings to numbers when necessary!

/*
REQUIREMENT 2: In my fishing guide service, I have a unique way of calculating tips. 
I round every guide's tips down to the nearest 10, and give the excess to the boat cleaner.

TODO: After this comment, create a function named 'roundDownToTens' that takes in a
positive integer and returns that integer rounded down to the nearest 10
*/

/*
REQUIREMENT 3: I took out a couple interest only loans to launch this guide service. I
think that I'm being overcharged. Help me out! If I just pay the interest amount,
what should my monthly payments be? 

TODO: After this comment, create a function named 'getMonthlyPayment' that takes
in principal (number) and annual interest rate (decimal) and returns the monthly interest
payment

EXAMPLE CALL
getMonthlyPayment(1000, .06) returns 5, since there would be $60 of interest over the year
Formula: principal times annual interest rate to find total interest for a year. Divide that by 12

/*
REQUIREMENT 4: Marginal tax rates can be confusing. What percent am I actually paying?

TODO: After this comment, create a function named 'getTaxRate' that takes in income
(number) and tax paid (number) and returns the average tax rate as a percent

EXAMPLE CALL
getTaxRate(50000, 7000) returns 14 since 7000/50000 is .14, which we multiply by 100 for the percentage

/*
REQUIREMENT 5: I like helping out other small business owners. I am loaning between 
$500 and $2000 to help someone launch their pizza company. We haven't worked out
the interest rate yet, but they guaranteed that they will pay it back in full 1 
year later. I need an IOU message from this person.

TODO: After this comment, create a function named 'makeIOweYou' that takes in
a loan amount (number) and interest rate (decimal), and returns a message that says
"I owe you $<amount>", where <amount> represents the total due after a year.

EXAMPLE CALL
makeIOweYou(750, .01) returns "I owe you $757.5"
makeIOweYou(1200, .02) returns "I owe you $1224"

/*
REQUIREMENT 6: I have 1 bait bucket per client. I want an equal amount of bait in each
bucket at the start of the day. How many pieces of bait will be left over after 
placing an equal amount in each bucket?

//TODO: After this comment, create a function named 'getLeftoverBait' that takes
in the number of pieces of bait (integer) and the number of buckets (integer),
and returns the number of pieces of bait that would remain (number)

EXAMPLE CALL
getLeftoverBait(100, 9) returns 1, since the 9 buckets would have 11 pieces each, with 1 leftover
*/

/*
REQUIREMENT 7: I get calls when the fishing heats up in certain areas. Can I make it to
the new location within 30 minutes?

TODO: After this comment, create a function named getDuration that takes in a velocity
in miles per hour and distance in miles, and returns the number of minutes the trip will take

EXAMPLE CALL
getDuration(40, 20) returns 30, since it takes 30 minutes to go 20 miles at 40 mph

/*
REQUIREMENT 8: Many fish populations are dwindling. Assuming that each fish can produce 5 fish 
per year, how many fish would we have in the future if fish were immortal? 

TODO: After this comment, create a function named getPopulation that takes in a
starting population (number) and number of years, and returns the future fish population (number)

EXAMPLE CALL
getPopulation(5,1) returns 30, since 5 fish each had 5 more fish.
getPopulation(10,2) returns 360, since 10 fish each had 5, then each of those 60 had 5 more.
